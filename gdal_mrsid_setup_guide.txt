1) To view:
  - QGIS (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html, "Standalone Installer", drag and drop image files, can convert to other file formats)
  - fGIS (https://www.forestpal.com/fgis.html, click on "Download a free, unlimited copy.", this is a simpler installation than QGIS, mainly for viewing)


2) Python (3.7, 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 [3.x versions are better for machine learning and are more up to date, these are the ones supported by GDAL in addition to 2.7]):
  - https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ (64-bit)


3) For GDAL in Python (latest is 3.2.1):

  - Open a Notepad, select the "Save as type:" drop down, choose "All Files (*.*)", and save the file as "sidTest.py"
  - Copy and paste the following:

#begin sidTest.py
from osgeo import gdal

fn = "C://...//file_name.sid"
ds = gdal.Open(fn)
if ds is None:
  print ("Could not open" + fn)

cols = ds.RasterXSize
rows = ds.RasterYSize
bands = ds.RasterCount
print ("cols: ", cols)
print ("rows: ", rows)
print ("bands: ", bands)
#end sidTest.py

  - Open command prompt and change the directory to where sidTest.py is located: cd C:\...
  - Run the program by typing: python sidTest.py
